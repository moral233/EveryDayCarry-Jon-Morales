  <h3>Short description</h3>
  <p>My keys include a car fob and a small house key. They live on a compact key ring clipped inside a pocket.</p>

  <h3>Why I can't leave without it</h3>
  <p>Without keys I can't lock/unlock or drive — they enable mobility and security for everything else I do in a day.</p>
